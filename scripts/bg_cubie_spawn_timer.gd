# I'm too stupid to figure it out but it should in theory be easy to
# grab the CPS value and set the timer's wait time in such a way that
# makes the background generate the same number of cubies/s

# maybe set some kind of rate cap so things don't get too goofy

# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
func _ready() -> void:
  pass

# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
func process(delta: float) -> void:
  pass
