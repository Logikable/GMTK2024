# CUBIE

Created for the [GMTK 2024 Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2024). \
The theme is **"Built to Scale"**.

We took this in the direction of an incremental game. \
You start with nothing but one colourful cube. \
Click it to make cubies. \
Buy a larger grid with those cubies. \
What's the limit?
